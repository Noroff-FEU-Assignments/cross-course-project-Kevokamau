    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? 
        Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
        
    <p id="web-security-answer">Because of the many online web threats like cross scripting, SQL Injection and Cross-site forgery.
        I would advice the client to use the best known web security methods or best practices. 
        These methods have been proven to work very well against threats and protects the clients users when using their website or service. 
        
        We should ensure the system accepts the correct format. We should use NodeJS to sanitise the HTML code and sanitise 
        the SQL codes with Object related mapping. We should also ensure the system uses a secure authentication 
        like the one NOROFF uses which is OneLogin. This ensures the system is hard to crack or misuse. 
        
        I would suggest the client to give me time to research all the third-party applications we will use are legit. 
        I will check how many downloads or user this applications gets or has. 
        The higher the download the more trusted it is. All the changes in code from developers should go through 
        checks and reject any that dont pass this checks, this can be achieved automatically by using CI/CD tools like Github Action. 
        
        We should also ensure the Network is secured to protect the exchange of data and this is dome ny ensuring that the
         network engineer and Front-end developer communicate about this. Implement automatic user timeout 
         and i will ensure the API i am using has considered this.
        
        Also i would suggest testing our systems regularly by performing security checks. 
        I would suggest performing mock security attacks or set up a bounty program.</p>
